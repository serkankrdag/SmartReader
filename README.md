# PHP Word Occurrence Counter

This PHP code counts the number of times a specific word appears in a text file using the built-in `substr_count` function. By calling the `count_word_occurrences` function and passing the filename and the word to search as arguments, it retrieves the contents of the file and uses `substr_count` to count the number of times the word appears in the text. The output displays the count of the word occurrences in the file.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Modify the `$filename` and `$word` variables in the code to match your use case.
4. Run the script using your favorite PHP interpreter.
5. The script will output the number of times the word appears in the file.

## Requirements
